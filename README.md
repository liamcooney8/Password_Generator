A simple password generator created by Liam Cooney.

Allows a user to make any length password, with varying encryption levels.

Encryption Levels:
- Level 1: uppercase + lowercase letters only
- Level 2: uppercase, lowercase, and numbers
- Level 3: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters

A generated password has no limit on length (although this might be changed to a high number like 1000 in the future)
